# Automated Defect Detection in a Manufacturing System

**Course:** Robotic Systems and CIM

**Academic Year:** 2020/21

**Semester:** 1st

**Grade:** 20 out of 20

**Technologies Used:** Java, JADE, Lua, Python, Flask, TensorFlow

**Brief Description:** Development of a computer vision solution to automate the quality inspection process of a Agile Cyber-Physical Production System using MAS. During the glue application process, there is a chance that the robot will malfunction and momentarily move at an irregular speed, or with an irregular flow of glue through the nozzle. This phenomenon will result in a defect in the product, which can occur at varied parts of the gluing path. The focus will be on the implementation and training of the CNN classifier, as well as on the server and respective service which will host, provide the classification functionality to recover the defective products and develop the control system that manages the manufactoring system in order to get an optimal result.

**Manufactoring System:**
- 2 Glue Stations
- 2 Quality Control Stations
- 1 AGV
- 1 Operator
- 3 Products
