# Computer Vision for Automated Defect Detection in a Manufacturing System

Course: Robotic Systems and CIM

Academic Year: 2020/21

Semester: 1st

Grade: 20 out of 20

Technologies Used: Java, JADE, Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Lua, EDU

Brief Description: Development of a computer vision solution to automate the quality inspection process of a Agile Cyber-Physical Production System using MAS. During the glue application process, there is a chance that the robot will malfunction and momentarily move at an irregular speed, or with an irregular flow of glue through the nozzle. This phenomenon will result in a defect in the product, which can occur at varied parts of the gluing path. The focus will be on the implementation and training of the CNN classifier, as well as on the server and respective service which will host and provide the classification functionality to the control system and recover the defective products.

The manufactoring system is composed by 2 glue stations, 2 quality control stations, 1 AGV and 1 Operator, dealing with 3 different product types.
